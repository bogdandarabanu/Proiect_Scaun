# Proiect_Scaun
In this Java project, I created the "Chair" class with the members IDFabric, price, noLegs, and yearManufacture. This class has all the components needed to process information about a seat. I implemented a method to test if a given chair has a manufacturing year greater than or less than 2000 and another method to return the number of legs for a given chair. I also implemented a comparison method that compares two chairs by price and a method that receives a list of chairs and a chair and checks whether the chair is part of the given list or not.
These functions are called in a main method "main()" to demonstrate their correctness and display appropriate messages. Additionally, I created a list of chairs and sorted this list by price, then checked if the first chair in the sorted list met the criteria of year of manufacture greater than or less than 2000.
